Stable tag: 0.5

== Description ==
List Category Posts is a simple WordPress plugin which allows you to list posts from a category into a post/page using the [catlist] shortcode. This shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can use [catlist] as many times as needed with different arguments. Great to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.
Usage: [catlist argument1=value1 argument2=value2].

==Installation==

* Upload listcat directory into you wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* Add “lcp_catlist” class into your theme’s CSS for custom formatting.
* You can find the List Category Posts widget in your widgets. Hasn't been tested, still in development, but usable.

**If you're updating List Category Posts from version 0.1**, you must change the code in the pages using it, since it's not backwards compatible. LCP now uses WordPress's shortcode API, in order to allow arguments. You should chang the previous [catlist=ID] to [catlist id=ID].

==Other notes==

**Usage**
The arguments you can use are:

* 'name' - To display posts from a category using the category's name. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory]

* 'id' - To display posts from a category using the category's id. Ex: [catlist id=24]. If you use both arguments (wrong!), List Category Posts will show the posts from the category in 'name'.

* 'orderby' - To customize the order. Valid values are: 
  * 'author' - Sort by the numeric author IDs.
  * 'category' - Sort by the numeric category IDs.
  * 'content' - Sort by content.
  * 'date' - Sort by creation date.
  * 'ID' - Sort by numeric post ID.
  * 'menu_order' - Sort by the menu order. Only useful with pages.
  * 'mime_type' - Sort by MIME type. Only useful with attachments.
  * 'modified' - Sort by last modified date.
  * 'name' - Sort by stub.
  * 'parent' - Sort by parent ID.
  * 'password' - Sort by password.
  * 'rand' - Randomly sort results.
  * 'status' - Sort by status.
  * 'title' - Sort by title.
  * 'type' - Sort by type. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory orderby=date]
  * 'order' - How to sort 'orderby'. Valid values are:
  * 'ASC' - Ascending (lowest to highest).
  * 'DESC' - Descending (highest to lowest). Ex: [catlist name=mycategory orderby=title order=asc]

* 'numberposts' - Number of posts to return. Set to 0 to use the max number of posts per page. Set to -1 to remove the limit. Default: 5. Ex: [catlist name=mycategory numberposts=10]

* 'date' - Display post's date next to the title. Default is 'no', use date=yes to activate it.

* 'author' - Display the post's author next to the title. Default is 'no', use author=yes to activate it.

* 'dateformat' - Format of the date output. Default is get_option('date_format')

* 'template' - File name of template from templates directory without extension. Example: For 'template.php' value is only 'template'. Default is 'default' that means template in code of plugin not in template file, that's an unordered list (ul html tag) with a CSS class: 'lcp_catlist'

* 'excerpt' - Display the post's excerpt. Default is 'no', use excerpt=yes to activate it.

Since version 0.2, List Category Posts includes a sidebar widget. It works pretty much the same as the plugin itself.
